# EMG-Slideshow

This app allows a user to control a slideshow of pictures and movies from a given file directory using muscles only (e.g. open and closing hands). Signal acquisition and processing are handled by the OpenBCI GUI. Normalized EMG data is then streamed via OSC to a simple neural network in Max. A facilitator prepares the user and has override control using a browser based interface via MIRA.
